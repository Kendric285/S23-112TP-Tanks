# S23-112TP-Tanks
This project is called Tanks and it is an adaptation of the tanks game from Wii Play. In this game the player has to move around and shoot the enemy tanks while avoiding the enemies attacks. The point of this game is to last as many waves of enemies as possible. 

To run this project run the tanks.py file and make sure all other python files are in the same folder
The only library used was the cmu graphics library so make sure you either have cmu graphics installed on your computer or have the graphics folder in the same folder as the oterh python files.

Some commands that may be helpful to you is the when you press 'c' all the enemies in that current wave are destroyed and you go on
to the next wave. Also pressing 'r' will restart the whole game taking you to the home page.

And that's all nothing extra is needed to run this game so have fun!!!
