In this final update of my project I have added 3 more things to the project

1. Added enemy movement: After the first wave the each enemy's movement is randomly chose to be stationary, 
move up and down, or left to right and right.

2. The use now can hold down on the trackpad and it will increase the bullet speed depending on how long 
the user holds down on the trackpad. But after 5 steps the user's tank will automatically shoot at maximum speed.

3. Finally on the start page it shows all the controls, and when the user dies there is an end game screen that
shows the user how many kills they got and how many waves they survived. Also on this end game page they can
click again to start the game over again.
